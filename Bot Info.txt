Version 1.0.2{
All The Features From Prev Versions

Important:
Added A Better Database For Memory

New:
Added Favorites To The Bot's Profile(Note: Just Because The Game You Want To Play Isnt On There Doesnt Mean You Cant Play It With The Bot, You Can Just Teach The Bot)
Also For Verbal Commands Added A Please Listen Command To Stop The Bot Completely Think Of It As A Force Stop Task(Note: I(The Owner) Will Get A Notification Everytime This Command Is Used, If Abused The Bot Will Leave The Current Instance. If I Think You Are Using The Command In A Bad Way You Will Get Muted/Blocked)
The Audio Has Been Updated So It Can Understand Hard Accents But Not Other Languages, So Only Supports English Speech.
Working On Being Able To Read Chatboxes If It Is Within A Radius I Set, Then Converts The Text Into A Prompt For The Bot.
Vision: Able To Pickup Up On Hand Suggestions For Example, Pointing Towards A Item, Pointing At Someone, Handing It Something, If You Stand Infront Of The Bot It Will Stand In The Spot And Waiting Around 2-10 Seconds Then Carry On With Its Prev Task.
Im Adding More Detections For Vision, Basic Hand Geastures, Can Detect If You Are Trying To Interact With It For Example(Hug, High Five, HandShake(etc..)) It Will Notice It And Try To Respond To It.
Added Even Better Self Learning Methods(Note: May Impact The Performance Of The Bot's Response Time And Movement)

Version 1.0.3{
All The Features From Prev Versions

Note: I've Seen That Some People Are Trying To Make The Bot Change Into A Different Avatar, I Will Allow It But Its On A Random Timer Between 1-8 Minutes Then Switches Back To The Orignal Avatar.

Important:
Changed Some Commands To Friends Only(Wont Say Them Due To Me Not Wanting The Bot To Get Exploited <3)
Also I've Seen The Join Instance Logs, Im Aware Of The Gun Worlds I Dont Mind It Just Make Sure Not To Teach It To Shot People Unless It's Apart Of The Game.

PS:
Reinforced Learning The Unversial Data File Is In Dev, I Will Be Testing It Only In Invite Sessions With It's Friends. Not Sure When I Will Add A Animation For It To Let You Know.

Beta:
Any New Friends Request Will Not Be Auto Accepted Anymore, The Bot Will Go Towards The Senders And Observse Them For 1-2 Minutes And "Redeem" If They Are Allowed The Friend Request.

New:


Auto Follow's Friend If Its In A World It Doesnt Know

Auto Observes And Tries To Mimic It, If It Mimics The Player And Doesnt Get Rewarded It Forgets The Actions And Tries Something Else

Made The Data File For Each World Read Before Loading In, So For Example If You Teached It Freeze Tag It'll Make A Data File Save All Correct Actions. Then If You Take It To A New World It Makes A Brand New Data File Named "Game Name".data

For The Reinforced Learning I Made It So It Tries A Universal Data File Methods For Games For Example Things You Can Click Glow Blue Line, Task, Clues Anything That Is Interactable. Also The Reward Pool, I Added Harder Expectations For Good Rewards And More Strict On The No-No Actions

Chatbox Support Has To Be In FOV Of The Bot To Be Prompted Correctly, The Range Is About 5-8 Meters In A Front Radius Of The Current Position Of The Bot

When In Game Worlds When Asked To Follow A Player In A Game World With The "Game" Tag In It. It Will Only Follow The Player If The Player Is In It's FOV. Meant So People Cant Abuse The Bot To Cheat And Find People.

Audio: It Can Remember Players Voices Can Understand Where A Person Is Based From Where Their Voice Comes From. Kinda Like A Dolphin EchoLocation XD

End:
The Bot Is Self-aware

Version Rework{
I Was Able To Recover Data On Some Worlds
Reinforced Learning Is Realeased Note It Was Still Dev Form I Havent Worked On It So Expect Bugs
May Add Body Control Not Sure
Also Pens Have Been Removed Due To A Person Making It Say A Racial Slur

Beta:
May Add A "Ai Voice" But Still Not Sure Because I Would Have To Right A Prompt, That Can Have Live Memory Which Isnt Possible, I Could Try Other Alternatives But Game Bot Itself Is Already Hard On My Current PC
